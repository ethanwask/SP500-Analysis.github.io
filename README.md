  <summary>The S&P 500 Index Explained üîë</summary>

## *The S&P 500 Index Explained*
The Standard and Poor's 500 Index is market-capitalization-weighted index of the 500 largest publicly traded U.S. companies. In essence, this weighting system measures companies through multiplying the equity price with shares outstanding. This weighting system is able to provide a "valuation" of these companies, thus putting the 500 most valuable publicly traded companies within the Index. Additionally, the Index is dynamic - meaning it's composition is  *always* changing alongside the market. Some companies may lose enough value to fall out of the index while others may increase their value enough to make their way in. However, it is widely believed within the financial sector that this index is one of the best gauges of the health of the economy due to it's depth and weighting. This depth can be seen through it's representation of various sectors which includes: technology, healthcare, financials, real estate, energy, materials, consumer discretionary, industrials, utilities, consumer staples, and commuications. Because of it's ability to gauge the health of the economy, we found the S&P 500 index to be an important resource to investors and economists when determining the state of the economy.

  <Summary>The S&P 500 Index Sectors üî®üí∞üí°</summary>
  
  ## *Sectors Explained*
  The S&P 500 Index is made up of the following 11 sectors:
  1. **Technology** üñ•Ô∏è
  : Includes the development or manufacturing of technology-related goods and services. This can span from software services to hardware such as a laptop or gaming console.
  2. **Healthcare** üè•
  : Includes pharmaceutical companies, health-care related services, or companies who create medical supplies and equipment. It is important to note that typically these companies' performance are not contingent on the perfromance of the economy as a whole. Typically, healthcare outperforms other sectors during times in which a recession is looming. 
  3. **Financials** üè¶
  : Includes a wide variety of industries including banks, investing services, credit unions, mortgage companies, credit card compmanies, and insurance companies. The financials sector is vast, as there is much variety in the services provided within the market. 
  4. **Real Estate** üèòÔ∏è
  : Includes realty agencies, property management companies, and real-estate investment trusts (REITs). This sector is typically not affected by the perfomance of stocks within the market, however they are incredibly sensitive to increases in interest rates. As interest rates rise, consumption and demand for real-estate typically falls, thus decreasing the sectors performance. 
  5. **Energy** ‚ö°
  : Includes the production and distribution of energy. This can span from solar power, electricity, gas, or even off-shore wind turbines. This sector is *very* sensitive to economic and supply-demand movements, as when demand falls, prices will generally fall alongside with it. We could observe this during the pandemic, as less people wwre traveling and more were staying home, driving down the cost of gasoline to historic lows. 
  6. **Materials** ü™µ
  : Includes companies involved with the production, distribution or sourcing of raw materials. This sector is similar to the energy sector, as it is extremely dependent on supply-demand movements within the market. As demand increases, prices increases and vice versa. 
  7. **Consumer Discretionary** üéí
  : Includes companies who provide consumers with normal or luxury goods, such as entertainment, travel, and hospitality. This sector is heavily dependent on the performance of the economy. During a prosperous economy, conumers will consume more goods within thius sector, however during a recession, consumers will consume less, therefore dirivng down the performanc eof this sector.
  8. **Industrials** üè≠
  : Includes companies involved with transportation or manufacturing goods. Similar to energy and materials, this sector is very reliant on the economy, as with rising demand, prices will increase and vice versa. 
  9. **Utilities** üí°
  : Includes companies who distribute gas, electricity, water, etc. to *households* and *firms*. Similar to healthcare, utlities are almost entirely unaffected by the economy, as they are an essential good. People and businesses need these goods in order to function, thus marking utilities as a very constant performing sector.
  10. **Consumer Staples** üõçÔ∏è
  : Includes companies who consumers purchase essential goods from such as groceries, hygenie products, etc... Similar to healthcare and utilities due to the fact that these goods are *essential* to consumers and regardless of the performance of the economy, they will still be consumed at an almost constant rate.
  11. **Communications** üì±
  : Includes companies who provide communication services in some way, such as cellular service providers, phone services, internet providers, or even cable television. This sector is somewhat reliant on the performance of the economy, as consumers will be driven to consume less of the good when prices increase or move to a cheaper option when an ecnomic downturn is present.

  <summary>Motivation üìàüöÄ</summary>

## *Motivation* üìàüöÄ
The financial sector is an integral part of the economy and it is what drives the global capital markets. Having such an influence on the economy of not just individual countries, but the world collectively, the financial sector is what brings together most countries regardless of politics, beliefs, or background. In order to better understand why the economy is the way it is, we wanted to look deeper into some of the factors that are driving the world markets. Through analyzing the Standard and Poor's 500 (S&P 500) Index, we would be able to give a snapshot of the current market as this index provides the top 500 U.S.-listed equities by market capitalization. Given these large-scale corporations, we will be able to provide our audience with a summary of the overall health of the economy and financial sector. Especially as of now, this is extremely relevant as many large financial institutions and global economies are bracing for what could be the next possible "large-scale" recession. This information could help our readers understand why the market is performing the way it is and potentially what to expect in the coming months. By providing readers with this information, we could help mitigate bad investment practices and potentially provide resources that could help investors decide upon investment opportunities within the market.

  <summary>Justification ‚öñÔ∏è</summary>
  
## *Justification* ‚öñÔ∏è
  
Our project is relevant to both economists, investors, and everyday citizens, as the possibility of a recession is able to impact people on all levels throughout the economy. By giving readers a central hub where articles are able to be drawn while also providing real-time data on the composition and perfomance of the index, we will be able to provide resources to our readers in which the events leading up to either a recession or slow-down will be observable and understood. When trying to understand why the economy is performing the way it is, economists are interested in geopolitical variables and monetary/fiscal policy changes, which are provided through the NYT Articles API. Additionally, both economists and investors will be interested in the perfomance of the S&P 500 Index, as this index provides a reliable gauge on the health of the economy.

<details>
  <summary>Data üìä</summary>

## *Data* üìä
By using the New York Times API, we will be able to provide readers with both quantitative and qualitative resources to complement each other. Through using New York Times' "Market Overview" section, readers will be able to observe the quantitiative side of the market, observing the perfomance of the various sectors and individual equities within the S&P 500 Index. Through the use of the New York Times Articles API, readers will be provided with an assortment of articles between January 1st, 2022 and March 31st, 2023 (end of Q1), in order to gain a general understanding of why the market is where it's at in terms of perfomance and overall economic health. As a recession looms, many people who are not necessarily up to date on the markets will be able to obtain a brief understanding of the events leading up to the state of the global economy now. 

### *Preliminary Challenges* üèÉ
Before choosing our data sources, we had to identify and address several problems that ultimately led to the evolution of our project. The first problem that we encountered was the structure of the S&P 500 Index itself, where U.S.-listed equities within the Index change daily according to each corporations' market capitalization. This means that if the value of a corporation drops enough, they can be replaced with the next largest corporation by market capitalization. This poses a problem as there is simply too much volatility in the market, meaning that there is so much movement that it is extremely difficult to collect and analyze real-time data as the Index is dynamic. This led us to morph our project into creating a "snapshot" of the Index's performance over the a window of about 1.25 years (Jan. 1st 2022 to March 31st 2023). This snapshow would help us give the reader a sense of the *overall* health of the economy, rather than just one Index within the exchange. As many large corporations are driving the global economy, analyzing the health of these corporations could help give the reader a general sense of how the economy is shaping, as within big tech, we are now seeing a wave of mass-layoffs that haven't been seen since the 2008 global financial crisis. This 1.25 year snapshot will allow readers to see some of the events that have led up to the state of the global economy, whether it's interest rate hikes, inflation, or even corporations missing EPS (earnings per share) expectations, these variables will be accessible to the reader and help give some underlying context on the matter. The second major challenge we faced were the data sources, as we orignially planned on using Kaggle, a subsidiary of Google, however after researching the reliability of this resource, we decided to not use Kaggle as we wanted to provide readers with accurate and up-to-date information such as an accredited news source such as NYT and SlickCharts, who provide real times data on these sources. In addition to SlickCharts, in order to obtain information on the various sectors that make up the S&P 500 Index, we will be using Wikipedia, as they provide real-time data on the index with sector information about each equity that will be useful when analyzing the makeup of the index.

### *Snippets of Code Used to Search API For Articles Containing S&P 500* üë®‚Äçüíª
 
  ```js
  import requests
import json

### GET ARTICLES MATCHING OUR QUERY ###
def get_url(q, begin_date, end_date):
    url = ("https://api.nytimes.com/svc/search/v2/articlesearch.json?q={0}&begin_date={1}&end_date={2}&api-key=GAgkTBB83AC0GwrrTCDTbUxv8R09Dq41".format(q, begin_date, end_date))
    return url

print("Querying NYTimes API...")
r = requests.get(get_url('S&P500', 20220101, 20230331))
print("Status Code returned {0}".format(r.status_code))
print("Data returned: ")
print(r.json()['response']['docs'])
  
  ```
By using the New York Times API, we can search for articles from January 1st to the end of Quarter 1 2023 in order to effectively gain a glimpse into the major news headlines that show the health of the market and the financial sector. The next step to present our data is to begin to parse and clean this data in order to give readers a cleaner, structured, and more organized compisition of articles. The next step will require the use of "Pandas" in order to clean up this data and present an appropriate format to our readers, as the response generated a mass of various text that will need to be parsed.
  
### *Using "Pandas" üêº to Structure and Clean our Data* 
  
By using the New York Times API, we can parse information to *only* provide articles on the **S&P 500 Index** as well as various other supporting articles that effect the perfomance of either the index or the market as a whole. Other queries include **markets, economy, and central banking** in which we are able to analyze some of the factors that can effect the perfomance of the market. Many equities can be affected by not only internal factors but also external ones, requiring the use of these queries. By parsing information for these queries, we are able to provide the readers with a more broader macroeconomic context, as policies from all over the world can affect the economy as a whole. The overall theme here is that the market has **many** variables that can affect perfomance **daily**.
  
 ```js
  import pandas as pd
df = pd.json_normalize(r.json()['response']['docs'])
  df
  
  ```
  
By using "Pandas" üêº, we are able to display the data into a chart, allowing for a more cleaner and accesible method to viewing the articles pulled that match our query. Now that the article are more organized, we must now convert this data into a CSV file, which will allow us to save our data into a table structured format.
  
### *Using Visual Studio Code to Convert Data into a .CSV File*
  
  *insert code and images for VSCode*
  
### *Webscraping SlickCharts üìä for S&P 500 Index Performance üèãÔ∏è*

Now that relevant articles are pulled from the NYT API, we must now find the relevant data containing company name, ticker symbol, weight (market capitalization), current price, change in price from day prior, and finally the percentage change in price. To do so, we will be webscraping SlickCharts for data on the S&P 500 Index. To do so, we will need to use a combination of BeautifulSoup ü•£ (which parses the data we want), Pandas üêº (which structures and organizes this data to be more streamline), and also Cloudscraper ‚òÅÔ∏è (in order to bypass cloudfare's "anti-bot" page). By utilizing these three components, we are able to present this data within a table, organized for our readers to examine.

While writing the code, we ran into an issue in which SlickChart's was detecting our webscraping as a bot. In order to bypass Cloudfare's bot detection, I used a tool called Cloudscraper ‚òÅÔ∏è, in which it bypasses this bot detection and is able to run the script and pull the relevant data ot be analyzed. By opening up the terminal and typing:

```js
pip install cloudscraper

 ```
Once Cloudscraper ‚òÅÔ∏è is installed, we are ready to pull data!

```js
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import pandas as pd
import cloudscraper

url = 'https://www.slickcharts.com/sp500'
scraper = cloudscraper.create_scraper(browser = 'chrome') # you can try 'firefox' here too?
page = scraper.get(url).text  # get the raw html text
soup = BeautifulSoup(page, 'html.parser') # convert html text to BeautifulSoup object

table1 = soup.find('table', class_='table-borderless') # get the first table
table1_head = table1.find_all('th') # isolate the head since this has the column headers we want
table1_body = table1.find('tbody') # isolate table body since this has the data aka "guts"

# Get headers of table (i.e., #, Company, Symbol, etc)
headers = []
for i in table1_head:
    # extract just the value using .string (i.e., Company, Symbol, etc) and clean it up
    headers.append(i.string.text.strip())

# Get the "guts" aka all data 
all_data = []  # set up a list where we'll store our final data
rows = table1_body.find_all('tr') # get all the rows first, in each row there will be data
for row in rows:  # loop through each row
    cols = row.find_all('td') # in the given row, find the data we'll need
    cols = [ele.text.strip() for ele in cols] # extract the data for the given row and clean it up
    all_data.append([ele for ele in cols]) # add the current data to our python list called "all_data"

# Print everything out
print(headers)
for item in all_data[:10]: # [:10] means go through the first 10 items in the list, can change to 20, etc
    print(item)
    
   ```
By combining these elements, we are able to pull all relevant data from the website in order to give our readers a "snapshot" of the health of the market, as the S&P 500 Index holds a large foothold and influence over the global markets. Typically when the S&P 500 Index underperforms, the market as a whole tends to follow the same trends, as most of the financial markets are driven by behavior (either bullish or bearish).

## *Exploratory Data Analysis üî≠üî¨üìä*
  
### *Further Analysis of the S&P 500 Index*
  
Now that we have a general understanding of the equities that make up the S&P 500 Index, we wanted to show our readers the various sectors this index covers in order to provide them with an additional understanding of the sectors that are performing well and those that are beginning to falter. By providing information regarding the sectors, we are able to show how some of the supplemental articles regarding geo-political events may influence the markets, more specifically these sectors. In order to find the sectors that makeup the index, we must once again webscrape, however this time we will be using Wikipedia, as the other resources provided fail to state the sectors that form the S&P 500 Index. We are abel to pull this ionformation by opening the terminal and typing:
  
```js
  
  # import the required libraries
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
url = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_S%26P_500_companies'
# sending a request to the site
page = requests.get(url)
# parsing the content
soup = BeautifulSoup(page.content, 'html.parser')
table = soup.find('table', {'class': 'wikitable sortable'})
  
  ```
  
Now that we pulled the required information, we need to create a DataFrame by utilizing Pandas üêº, in which we will type into the terminal:
  
  ```js
  
  import pandas as pd
# Extract data from wikipedia 
rows = table.find_all('tr')
data_list = []
for row in rows:
    data = row.find_all('td')
    try:
        company = data[0].find('a').get_text()
        sector = data[3].get_text()
        data_list.append([company, sector])
    except:
        pass

# Create DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data_list, columns=['Company', 'Sector'])
print(df)

   ```
  
  Once we input and run the code, a DataFrame is produced in which each individual equity's sector is defined and structured within a table. Now, we want to find the various sector names that makeup the S&P, rather than search the entire index for this information. We will do so by typing the following within the terminal:
  
   ```js
  df['Sector'].unique()
   ```
Now we are able to see the individual sectors that makeup the index, rather than searching through all of the equities. Knowing the individual sectors is important to us, as we want to be able to examine how different macroeconomic variables within the news may affect the health of not just the economy as a whole, but potentially even just sectors. For example, new healthcare regulations may affect the health sector or growing anti-trust laws may affect big tech. This information is vital for us in order to give our readers resources to determine the overall state of the economy/sectors. 
  
Next, we want to be able to identify the number of equities within each sector, as this will help us determine top perfomring sectors (those with the highest nuber of equities in the index) or the lowest perfroming sectors (those with the least number of equities in the index). We will do so by typing the following code in the terminal:
  
   ```js
  # Group data by sector and count the number of firms in each sector
sector_count = df.groupby('Sector').size()
# Convert this dataframe to a dictionary
sector_count = sector_count.to_dict()
#Counting the number of firms per sector
sector_count = df['Sector'].value_counts()
sector_count
  ```
  
This code will give us the amount of equities within the exchange in each individual sector, which will help us find what we were looking for in the paragraph above. 
  
 ### *Structuring Data Visualizations Using Madplotlib* üìä
 
Although we have all relevant information, we still need to provide our readers with visualizations that will display this infomation. Visualizations are crucial to our data analysis as they provide an avenue to analyze data in a clean and concise manner that is able to quickly show patterns or correlations between variables. In order to provide our readers with these visualizations, we will utilize Madplotlib, a plotting library used to analyze data extracted using Python üêç. First, we will be creating a bar chart using Madplotlib, in which we will write the following code within the terminal:
  
  ```js
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
sector_count.plot(kind='bar')
plt.xlabel('Sector')
plt.ylabel('Number of Firms')
plt.title('Number of Firms per Sector')
plt.show()
   ```
  
By utilizing this code, we are able to output a bar chart that looks like this:
  
  ![S P Bar Graph Python](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118006806/214340026-4fbbc2f0-e094-45e7-84d1-74b7d371ea03.png)

  
Alternatively, we can show the proportion of the equities that makeup the S&P 500 Index by using Madplotlib, specifially their pie chart ü•ßüìä feature, in which we write the following code within the terminal: 
  
  ```js
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.pie(sector_count, labels=sector_count.index, autopct='%1.1f%%')
plt.title('Percentage of Firms per Sector')
plt.show()
   ```
By using Madpoltlib we are able to output a pie chart that represents our data that looks like this:
  
  ![S P Pie Chart Python](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118006806/214339815-86e2a215-ccaa-4dca-a356-fa6470ee7d49.png)

After seeing the proportion of equities that makeup the various sectors within the index, it is now clear that five sectors dominate the market, which are: technology, industrials, financials, healthcare, and consumer discretionary. This gives us a new persepctive when understanding the market, as due to having more equtiies with higher market capitalization within these five sectors, it is clear that the current macroeconomic environment is allowing for these sectors to grow. Now, with this information, when seeing a specific ticker associated with the S&P 500 Index within the NYT Articles that were webscraped, there can be an understanding of the current market share that the equity is within. 

### *Analyzing the Top 10 Firms*

Now that we understand the general makeup of the S&P 500 Index, we want to be able to show all relevant information pertaining to the top 10 equities in order to fully understand if there is a general trend showing that there is in fact, a top performing sector. To do so, we will examine the top 10 equities within the index (the firms with the largest market capitalization). 

By using the existing dataframe we formed using Pandas üêº, we will now look for *only* the top 10 equities within the index. To do so, we will type the following within the terminal:

```js
#Change the Price and Change values from an object to a numeric datatype
df['Price'] = pd.to_numeric(df['Price'], errors='coerce')
df['Chg'] = pd.to_numeric(df['Chg'], errors='coerce')

#Remove the Percentage Symbol and Brackets from the percentage change column
df['% Chg'] = df['% Chg'].str.replace('%', '')
df['% Chg'] = df['% Chg'].str.replace('(', '')
df['% Chg'] = df['% Chg'].str.replace(')', '')

#Sort the firms by price in descending order
df.sort_values("Price", ascending=False, inplace=True)

#Print the data for the top 10 firms
print(df.head(10))

#Create a new dataframe with the data for just the top 10 firms
df_10 = df.head(10)

print(df_10)

#checking for missing values with new dataframe
df_10.isna().sum()
```

By running the following code, we are able to convert the data from the previous dataframe into numeric data and sort the firms by price in descending order in order to give us a new dataframe containing just the top 10 firms. This new dataframe will allow us to look even further into the top performing firms and hopefully draw connections to which sectors may be outperforming others. 

#### *Changes in Prices from the Top Firms*

In order to gauge the health of the economy, analyzing the discrepencies in prices is vital to be able to understand how volatile the market is and if there are a significant amount of firms exhibiting decreases in value, there is some indication that the market is eithe underperfomring for that day, or if it extends for a brief period, a recession may be looming. 

To observe this, we must find the current prices of the top 10 firms and be able to visualize this data through graphs. To do so, we will once again be using Madplotlib to visually display our findings and type the following within the terminal: 

```js
# Create a list from the price and symbol column in the DataFrame
column_name = 'Price'
column_list_price = df_10[column_name].tolist()
top_firm_price = column_list_price[:10]
print(top_firm_price)
[799.2, 740.18, 734.3, 716.68, 695.73, 581.2, 574.26, 567.53, 502.62, 502.12]
column_name = 'Symbol'
column_list_symbol = df_10[column_name].tolist()
top_firm_symbol = column_list_symbol[:10]
print(top_firm_symbol)
['ORLY', 'REGN', 'BLK', 'EQIX', 'TDG', 'AVGO', 'TMO', 'GWW', 'HUM', 'MSCI']
#Invert the list, so prices are in ascending order
top_price = top_firm_price[::-1]
#Invert the firm's symbols to match their prices
top_firms = top_firm_symbol[::-1]
# Create a bar chart displaying the prices for the Top Firms
plt.bar(top_firms,top_price, color='red')
plt.xlabel('Firms')
plt.ylabel('Price')
plt.title('Prices of the shares of the Top Firms')
```

By using Madplotlib, we are able to create a bar graph displaying the prices of the top 10 firms which looks like:

![Prices of the Shares of the Top Firms](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118006806/214691598-03a24748-7372-483a-89a9-0b662cbbbc57.png)

Now that we know the top 10 firms within the index as well as their prices, we now want to be able to observe any price discrepencies these equities may have experienced, as with this information we will be able to see whether or not these firms are underperforming even as the top performers. 
  
To structure this data into a chart, we will type the following into the terminal: 
  
```js
  #Create a list from the price change column
column_name = 'Chg'
column_list_chg = df_10[column_name].tolist()
top_firm_chg = (column_list_chg[:10])[::-1]
print(top_firm_chg)
[-17.72, 2.27, -3.31, -6.46, -3.83, 1.48, -2.94, -17.77, 12.71, 0.11]
#Make a bar chart showing the price change for each firm
plt.bar(top_firms,top_firm_chg)
plt.xlabel('Firms')
plt.ylabel('Price Change')
plt.title('Price Changes of the shares of the Top Firms')
  ```

By changing the axis labels and analyzing the price changes, we are able to see any discrepencies in prices with these firms, which looks like:
  
  ![Price change of firm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118006806/214693008-9c395078-bb6f-448c-93d4-3a14e7e28f17.png)

Although we may be able to see price changes, percent changes will be able to effectively display these discrepencies relative to the equities' existing prior price point. This will help us gauge the extent to which the proportion of it's value has either *fallen* or *risen*. 
  
To find this, we will once again use Madplotlib to create a bar chart by writing the following within the terminal:
  
  ```js
 #Make a list using the percentage change column
column_name = '% Chg'
column_list_chg = df_10[column_name].tolist()
top_firm_per_chg = (column_list_chg[:10])[::-1]
print(top_firm_per_chg)
['-3.41', '0.45', '-0.58', '-1.11', '-0.66', '0.21', '-0.41', '-2.36', '1.75', '0.01']
#Make a bar chart for the percentage change in the price of each firm
plt.bar(top_firms,top_firm_chg,color='green')
plt.xlabel('Firms')
plt.ylabel('Percentage Change')
plt.title('Percentage Change in the Price of the shares of the Top Firms')
  ```

From this we can now be able to effectively show the discrepencies in prices relative to the firms prior price. Through this visualization, it is clear that there is some slowdown or even decrease in growth, as the majority of these firms are exhibiting negative movements in prices. 
  
#### *Sector Composition of the Top 10 Firms*
  
For investors and economists, understanding the perfomance of different sectors is crucial to understanding why the economy and markets are behaving how they are. For example, the price of industrial equities may be performing well at the end of the COVID-19 Pandemic due to the supply chain issues, thus driving prices up. Additionally, the war in Ukraine may be putting pressure on the energy sector as there is a very limited supply of natural gasses, thus increasing the prices of equities within the energy sector. To be able to observe similar effects within the market, we will be looking at the composition of the top 10, followed by the top 20 equities within the S&P 500, as we may be able to draw the same conclusions with the sectors within this dataset. 
  
To find this, we must once again create a new dataframe, in which the composition of the top 10 equities are displayed within a bar üìä and pie chart ü•ß. Through these charts, we will be able to visualize the varying performances of each sector, as the sectors with the most equities within the top 10 will be seen as the top performing sectors, and the sectors with the least equities from the top 10 will be seen as "underperfomers". To form these charts, we will input the following within the terminal:
  
   ```js
  symbols = top_firm_symbol
#make a dataframe containing the sector information for the top 10 firms
import pandas as pd
from yahooquery import Ticker


tickers = Ticker(symbols, asynchronous=True)

datasi = tickers.get_modules("summaryProfile quoteType")
dfsi = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(datasi).T
dataframes = [pd.json_normalize([x for x in dfsi[module] if isinstance(x, dict)]) for
module in ['summaryProfile', 'quoteType']]

dfsi = pd.concat(dataframes, axis=1)

dfsi = dfsi.set_index('symbol')
dfsi = dfsi.loc[symbols]

print(dfsi[['industry', 'sector']])
   ```

This will create a new dataframe and segregate the data into just the top 10 equities and list the sector composition, which appears as:
  
  ```js
                           industry               sector
symbol                                                      
ORLY                    Specialty Retail   Consumer Cyclical
REGN                       Biotechnology          Healthcare
BLK                     Asset Management  Financial Services
EQIX                      REIT‚ÄîSpecialty         Real Estate
TDG                  Aerospace & Defense         Industrials
AVGO                      Semiconductors          Technology
TMO               Diagnostics & Research          Healthcare
GWW              Industrial Distribution         Industrials
HUM                     Healthcare Plans          Healthcare
MSCI    Financial Data & Stock Exchanges  Financial Services
   ```
  
Now that a dataframe is created, we want to be able to organize this information into a table where it is easy to determine which sectors have the highest proportion of the top 10 equities, however we must first put this data into numerical form, where we are able to graph this information. To do so, we will try and find the number of equities within each sector by writing:
  
  ```js
  #Find how many firms are in each sector
dfsi.groupby('sector').size()
  ```
Which will give us an output of:
  
   ```js
  sector
Consumer Cyclical     1
Financial Services    2
Healthcare            3
Industrials           2
Real Estate           1
Technology            1
dtype: int64
  ```
Now that we have numerical data, we are able to create the charts and structure our data into visualizations. By using Madplotlib again, we will be able to achieve this by writing the following within the terminal:
  
  ```js
  #Plot this data in a pie chart and a bar chart
dfsi.groupby('sector').size().plot(kind='bar')
plt.title("Number of Firms Per Sector, among the top 10 firms")
plt.show()
dfsi.groupby('sector').size().plot.pie(autopct='%.2f', figsize=(5,5))
plt.title("Proportion of sectors among the top 10 Firms")
  ```
  
Which will give us an output of:
  
![bar chart of top 10](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118006806/215081530-b9ccb90b-2166-49f7-8f4b-0598841a7823.png)

![pie chart of top 10](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118006806/215081559-3c0135ee-4323-4152-9c6f-69d2b3499075.png)

From this data we can see somewhat of a normal distrubution curve, in which financial services, healthcare, and industrials sectors appear to make up the majority of the index. Although this may show that the majority of these equities are within these three sectors, the sample size proves to be a challenge as 10 equities trying to represent 11 sectors is not an optimal method of trying to find performance. In order to see a more accurate representation, we will increase the sample size to 20, as we do not want to include a majority of the index in order to ensure that we analyze the *top* performers. We will run the same code, however now we will replace the numerical value of "10" for "20" and ger the following outputs:
  
  ![bar chart top 20](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118006806/215083365-163cfa58-24ed-4774-9eb2-0a36b665e8c0.png)

By increasing the sample size, there is now a clear distinction in datasets, as similar to the dataset prior, both healthcare and industrials sectors contain more equities within the top 20 than any other sector. Additionally, we can see which sectors are underperfomring as real estate, technology, and consumer discretionary seem to be lagging behind the rest. This may suggests that there are currently issues ongoing within the market that are affecting these sectors, which we will dive into next.

## *Explaining the Factors Behind our Findings* ü§î‚ùî

### *Top Performing Sectors*
After observing the data, it is clear that healthcare and industrials are performing well. However, why is this? Healthcare has historically been dominant within the index, as within the U.S., prices are exorbitantly high and there will constantly be a need for innovation in treatment. On average, Americans spend over $4.3 trillion a year on healthcare, which is roughly $12,000 per person per year within the U.S. (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services). Due to historic trends, this performance is no surprise. For industrials, however, this is a much different story. Coming out of the pandemic, the U.S., including the vast majority ofthe world, faced supply-chain issues. With a shortage of truck drivers, bottleneck issues, and a high demand for goods used in construction caused the prices of these goods (including the valie of the corporations themselves) to skyrocket. Although suply-chain issues have cooled, issues are still prevelant and driving prices to skyrocket. 
  
### *Bottom Performing Sectors*
On the other hand, real estate has taken a severe hit this year following the Federal Reserve's decision to increase interest rates to historic highs, as we have been seeing increases reaching increments as high as 0.75% per month, to where the Fed Funds Rate is 4.33%. The Fed Funds Rate is symbolic within the market, as an increase in interest rates from the Fed signal a looming recession and more money being taken out of the money supply. One of the ways in which money is being taken out of the money supply is through mortgage rates, in which the 30-year fixed-mortgage rate is 6.45%, the highest since the 2008 global financial crisis. This is causing demand for the housing and real-estate market to fall sharply, affecting the value of the equities within the real-estate sector. As for technology, big tech has seen a massive increase in growth even throughout the pandemic, however with growing concerns over anti-trust laws with Meta, Google, Apple, and now Microsoft after their acquisition of Activision Blizzard, tech has taken an extreme hit in valuation. Coupled with increasing interest rates and a rising probability of recession, mass layoffs have been taking place in which between 3-10% of these big tech companies' workforce are being let go. This suggests that these companies are bracing for what could be the next "big" recession, as they are prepping for cost management through layoffs. Lastly, consumer discretionary (non-essential goods for consumption) are now being viewed as normal goods during a time in which fears of a recession are growing. At times in which consumers face a possible recession, historically consumers have decreased their consumption and saved more, thus causing the value of these equities and the sector as a whole to fall. Additionally, consumers are now being pushed towards to consuming inferior goods (those in which are cheaper) as they are undergoing the "substitution effect" (when the price of one good increases, consumption of the cheaper good increases).

  <summary>Concluding Remarks</summary>

### *Concluding Remarks*

Our findings align closely to the patterns that are occuring within the market right now. As discussed, healthcare and industrials have seen massive growth over the last 1.25 years when compared to the underperforming sectors such as real estate, tech, and consumer discretionary. The COVID-19 pandemic shook the world and it's affects are still being felt heavily within the financial markets today. The massive stimulus programs helped promote consumption during a time in which consumers were sheltered and saving money, however this only helped create a new worry: inflation. Both the UK and the US, as well as the vast majority of other developed markets experienced an inflation crisis in which central banks heightened rates to historic highs. These rates indirectly negatively impacted the housing market, the tech sectors, as well as consumer spending, as seen from the performance of these sectors within the Index. Although the global capital markets have yet to see a slowdown in GDP growth, concerns are still high as fears of recession begin to loom. It is too early to decide whether or not a recession is to come, however indicators are pointing to a high likelihood that we may experience a brief recession in the next few quarters. 

It is important to note for investors that an underperforming market and recessions are perfect opportunities to help kickstart investing, as prices of equities reach historic lows and once we emerge from a recession prices will readjust to normal levels. Although many fear recession, it is a great opportunity to learn about trends within the market and consider the many different variables that go into the performance of not just an invdidual sector or index, but the economy as a whole.
